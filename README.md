## Hi there 👋
👋 Hey there!

I'm **Luiz Lamyanba**, an aspiring **Cloud Security Engineer** and an **ECE undergraduate** based in India 🇮🇳.

I’m building my way into cloud security by learning in public, breaking systems, securing them, and documenting everything I learn along the way.

If something feels confusing in cloud or security — chances are I’m already trying to automate, understand, or secure it.
